Physical examination should begin with inspection of the injured extremity using the uninjured extremity as a comparison. The site of injury may be identified by ecchymosis or swelling. Fractures of the distal radius may have characteristic deformities. Look for any evidence of a break in the skin indicating an open fracture. Palpation with localization of the point of maximal tenderness further defines the injury.
With scaphoid fractures, the point of maximal tenderness lies in the anatomic snuffbox, which lies between the tendons of the extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus. Radial deviation of the wrist or axial loading of the first metacarpal may increase pain.
The lunate can be localized just distal to the Lister tubercle, which is palpable on the dorsal radius. Axial loading of the third metacarpal may increase pain with a lunate injury. In addition, lunate fractures may be associated with point tenderness over the lunate fossa (located distal to the radius at the base of the long finger metacarpal).
The classic finding in a Colles fracture is the so-called dinner fork deformity, which is produced by dorsal displacement of the distal fracture fragments. A Smith fracture may show an obvious volar displacement of the wrist relative to the forearm, known as a garden spade deformity.

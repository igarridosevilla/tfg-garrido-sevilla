In a patient with a knee injury, confirm that an acute traumatic event occurred. Document mechanism of injury, type and location of pain (ie, ask the patient to point to area of pain), associated symptoms, amount of immediate dysfunction, presence and onset of joint swelling, and history of past knee problems. Verify that the cause of the knee problem is mechanical by establishing that pain is exacerbated by movement (eg, walking, climbing, jumping). Inquire about ability to bear weight on the affected limb.

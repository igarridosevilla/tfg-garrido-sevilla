Conduct a thorough examination to rule out associated injury. Associated hip fractures and ligamentous knee injuries are commonly observed with femoral shaft fractures. [25] At the site of fracture, tenderness on examination and visible deformity typically are noted.
The extremity may appear shortened, and crepitus may be noted with movement. The thigh is often swollen secondary to hematoma formation.
Perform a thorough vascular examination on the extremity. Signs of vascular compromise should prompt arteriography and a vascular surgery consult. Physical signs of arterial injury include expanding hematoma, absent or diminished pulses, and progressive neurologic deficits in a closed fracture.
Because of extensive blood supply to the musculature surrounding the femur, diaphyseal fractures may be associated with significant blood loss (ie, 1 L or more) and resulting tachycardia and hypotension.
Test distal neurologic function, though examination is frequently unreliable because of the amount of pain associated with these fractures. Nerve injury is rare because of protective surrounding musculature.
